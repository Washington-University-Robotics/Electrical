Ethan Worked to get the networking running again, running into issues with the router not detecting the ubiquity rockets on the system. For this reason we will make our own Raspberry Pi 4B 4Gb version. We will power this using our Netgear PoE+ switch with the Pi having the associated PoE+ Hat so that it will be powered by the router (less power connections required). 

Issac has now been assigned to work with the Science Team to develope the system required for the competition. 

We also met new members today, with Holt and Nedra working with Alvin on the Power PCB and K Han working with me to most likely be working initially to find the correct sensors for the rover to comply with competition rules. 

It was identified that in order for the power system design to continue:
- Science team need to give us a list of specifications for the electrical components that will most likely be used
- Science team need to give a list of specification that that will be using (Issac is working with will).
