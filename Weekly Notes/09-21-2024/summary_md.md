# Thursday 9/19

Kubas and Alvin went over the relevant rules of the competition, looking into the needed sensors. These sensors are:
* Zed 2 camera
* 360 camera for science panoramic
* GNSS sensor
* IMU for shock detection
* magnetometer 

K was assigned to look into what GNSS Sensors would be best for our purposes
Morton continued on Networking documentation.

# Saturday 9/21

K continued GNSS research and will need to get finalized options by Saturday 9/28. 
Morton Finished Networking Docs.

Issac is working with science to get a list of components and sensors. It was also finalized that the science module will get **it's own RasPi** since they will be using cameras. 

The Arm will be going with the [12V GoBuilda](https://www.gobilda.com/yellow-jacket-planetary-gear-motors) motors but will be changed to the ones with higher ratios for lower power consumption.
