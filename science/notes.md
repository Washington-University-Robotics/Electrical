### 9/21
- Finalized electrical component list so that we can create a PCB for the science module.
- The prospect of building a spectrometer is UP in the air right now. I aim to continue doing research but
had to give very rough power estimates based off other rover teams.
- In the process of creating a python file that controls lower and turns on an augur attached to a linear actuator using a pi.
- Going to try using the Pyserial class, still need to pip install though
